        This class implements the traditional KMeans algorithm with hard assignments:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering

        The KMeans algorithm has two steps:

        1. Update assignments
        2. Update the means

        While you only have to implement the fit and predict functions to pass the
        test cases, we recommend that you use an update_assignments function and an
        update_means function internally for the class.

        Use only numpy to implement this algorithm.
